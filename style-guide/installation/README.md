# Gatsby Theme Emulsify

### Summary

Emulsify Design System contains a fully customizable/theme-able style guide _generator_ built with Gatsby. It reads your documentation and component library and builds a style guide for you. Using MDX you can author custom documentation for your components as well as any other pages for your design system audience.

### Setup

#### Installation

As per [Gatsby theme best practices](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2019-05-22-setting-up-yarn-workspaces-for-theme-development/), this repo is a Yarn workspace containing the Gatsby theme as well as an `example` directory to see how to use it in a project.

To install just the Gatsby theme in your project, run:

`npm i gatsby gatsby-theme-emulsify`

#### Setting up Basic Site Information

Create a local `gatsby-config.js` file (see [the example one](https://github.com/emulsify-ds/gatsby-theme-emulsify-workspace/blob/master/example/gatsby-config.js) for documented options) and enter your basic site information in the `siteMetadata` fields.
