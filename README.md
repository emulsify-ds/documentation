Emulsify is an open-source tool for creating design systems with reusable components and clear guidelines for teams. Emulsify helps organizations scale their design while reducing cost, streamlining workflows, and improving accessibility.

Emulsify Design System contains multiple packages, which can be used individually to solve small problems or together to solve big ones. See below for some of the popular packages.

## Starters

<!-- What does this mean? We need to define "Starters." -->

- Emulsify Drupal
- Emulsify Wordpress Theme

<!--
Emulsify Drupal is a full prototyping development environment using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) as a component library and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as a build engine. It is also a [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) theme. It can be used as a standalone prototyping tool or inside a Drupal installation. It supports both Twig and React components out of the box! Because it's using Storybook, any number of languages can be supported with the correct configuration.
