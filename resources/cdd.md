# Component-Driven Design

Component-driven design is a way to systematize and share designs as functional prototypes. Emulsify uses the [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) system for organization.

* **Atoms** are the basic building blocks of matter. Applied to web interfaces, atoms are our HTML tags, such as a form label, an input or a button.
* **Molecules** are where things start to get more tangible as we start combining atoms together. Example, a search form comprised of a label, input and submit button.
* **Organisms** allow us to combine molecules into something relatively complex, such as a distinct section of the interface. Example, the header or footer of a site.
* **Templates** consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages. Itâ€™s here where we start to see the design coming together and start seeing things like layout in action. Example, article node page.
* **Pages** are specific instances of templates. Here, placeholder content is replaced with real representative content to give an accurate depiction of what a user will ultimately see.

We accomplish this by using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/). Because both Storybook and Drupal 8 can use Twig for templates, this means that the design components that get built can be used directly by systems such as Drupal! ðŸŽ‰

### How to use Storybook

Organizing components using the [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) system and seeing those components come to life in Storybook is extremely rewarding. It's worth taking a few moments to read the [Storybook documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/introduction/), particularly the section on [Writing Stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/writing-stories/). Below are a few basic principles.

1. **Structure:** All components \(all HTML, CSS, JS\) are housed in the `components` directory.
2. **Global mixins, code:** Code that is global belongs in `components/00-base`. By default, there are files for mixins, variables, breakpoints, layout, and more.
3. **Building a component:** A component is commonly comprised of an HTML file \(using Twig in our case\), a CSS file \(using Sass in our case\) and possibly a Javascript file. `components/01-atoms/links/link/link.twig` is a good example of a simple link component. Please store all code for a component together inside the component's directory.
4. **Storybook Specific:** Storybook allows you to use YAML or JSON files to insert data in your components \(we use YAML by default\). It also allows you to easily add variations for a component. See `components/01-atoms/buttons/buttons.stories.js` for a an example.
5. **Drupal-related:** There are other files in the prototyping system specific to Drupal, which you can ignore while prototyping as they have no effect on building the components in Storybook \(e.g., the `/templates` directory\).
