# FAQ

### What is the difference between a Style Guide and Pattern Library?

Put simply, a Pattern Library unifies a production team and a style guide unifies an organization. A Pattern Library is a tool often used by developers and designers to unify around building project components - good examples of these are [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and [Pattern Lab](https://patternlab.io/). A style guide can include components from the Pattern Library but also includes other information useful to other teams such as content editors, user experience, accessibility and executives. A good example of a style guide is [Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/).

### What is a Design System?

A Design System combines a style guide and a Pattern Library \(see above\). It is both [the workshop and the storefront](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-workshop-and-the-storefront/).
